# Turbo-C-Interface-Simulation-Using-C

Description:
This project is a demonstration of system programming concepts implemented in C, where a graphical user interface simulates the Turbo C++ environment. The application utilizes text-based graphics to create a menu-driven interface that enables user interaction similar to the original Turbo C++ IDE.

Platform - turbo c++

Key Features:

Menu Navigation: The program includes a horizontal menu bar with options such as "File," "Edit," "Search," and more. Users can navigate through these options using arrow keys, highlighting the selected item dynamically.

Functional Submenus: Upon selecting the "File" option, a submenu appears, offering functionalities like "New," "Save," and "Quit." The program allows further navigation within these submenus, enhancing user experience.

Visual Elements: The interface utilizes various text colors and backgrounds to distinguish between active and inactive menu items, providing clear visual feedback.

Interactive User Input: Users can enter their choices via keyboard input, facilitating an interactive session where selections and commands are processed in real-time.

Window Management: The application effectively manages different windows for the main menu, submenus, and informational displays, demonstrating concepts of window handling and layout design in console applications.

This project not only reinforces the principles of system programming but also illustrates the practical application of C in creating user interfaces. It serves as an excellent portfolio piece for showcasing programming skills and understanding of user interaction within a system-level context.
